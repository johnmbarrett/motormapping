# motormapping
Matlab code for conducting motion analysis from motor mapping experiments.  Currently heavily oriented towards the data generated by the in-vivo laser scanning optogenetic motor mapping experiments conducted in the Shepherd lab, but maybe one day I'll extend it to be more general purpose, e.g. with more motion tracking algorithms and support for standard data formats (as opposed to the weird ones we use).
